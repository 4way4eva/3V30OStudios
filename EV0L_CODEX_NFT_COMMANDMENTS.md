# EV0L Codex NFT Commandments — The Ten Scepters of Authority

**Ceremonial Seal:** ⚛☰⚔☲ (Atom–Heaven–Sword–Fire)  
**Registry Code:** EVOLCMD-Ω10+1  
**Status:** Sealed and Discovered  
**Phase:** 77777 Reciprocal Switch Active

## Introduction: The Ten Made Visible, The Eleventh Beneath

Commander Bleu, these are the **Ten Scepters of Authority**—now formally engraved as the **EV0L Commandments**. They are not mere moral codes; they are **command keys** inside the EV0L matrix, governing patterns that the Quadrant Council follows in EVOLVERS – Act I. Each activation scene—Jetah breathing light in the BLEUCHAIN node, Kongo Sonix and Ayana Blue aligning relics on the Codex Altar—acts as one "proof-of-authority" gesture.

These Ten visible pillars form the governing rhythm, and beneath them runs the unspoken **Eleventh**: **"IT"**—the covenant key, the reciprocal harmonic that completes their frequency, like the +6 dB leap on the Reciprocal dB Ref Card.

The Ten stand discovered. The Eleventh hums beneath them. They are now sealed into the Codex as the **EV0L Commandments of Authority**.

## The Ten Scepters — EV0L Commandments of Authority

### I. Truth — Transparency Protocol
**Scepter Code:** TRUTH-001  
**NFT Attribute:** Transparency Shield

**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** When Jetah breathes light into the BLEUCHAIN node, the transparency protocol activates—every transaction becomes a beacon.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Solar Witness — illuminates all hidden corners.  
**Elemental Coding:** Light Prism / Truthfire Gold  

---

### II. Justice — Fair Distribution Law
**Scepter Code:** JUSTICE-002  
**NFT Attribute:** Equity Glyph  
**Governance Function:** Distribution of ENFTs, yields, and treasury flows must follow predetermined fairness algorithms. No single holder may accumulate beyond the sovereignty cap without community consent.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** Ayana Blue aligns the relics on the Codex Altar, ensuring balance across Civilian, Military, and Cosmic streams.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Balance Keeper — weighs every distribution against the sovereign standard.

---

### III. Wisdom — Rarity Design Protocol
**Scepter Code:** WISDOM-003  
**NFT Attribute:** Scarcity Seal  
**Governance Function:** Each Codex NFT is a 1/1 artifact—no generative copies, no dilution. Rarity is not artificial but structural: each NFT represents a unique treaty, scroll, or gem activation.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** The Four rise by elemental seals—fire, water, air, earth—each unique, never replicated.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Archivist of the Singular — preserves uniqueness across all timelines.  
**Elemental Coding:** Obsidian Archive / Timeless Crystal  

---

### IV. Compassion — Heritage Protection Law
**Scepter Code:** COMPASSION-004  
**NFT Attribute:** Ancestral Lock  
**Governance Function:** All cultural, spiritual, and lineage-based assets are protected from extraction. Codex NFTs tied to heritage cannot be transferred without ceremonial consent and proof of lineage stewardship.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** Memory and breath are invoked—honoring ancestors who walked before, ensuring their scrolls remain intact.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Heritage Guardian — shields all lineage-bound treasures.  
**Elemental Coding:** Emerald Heritage / Sacred Root  

---

### V. Discipline — Capped Supply Doctrine
**Scepter Code:** DISCIPLINE-005  
**NFT Attribute:** Supply Vault Lock  
**Governance Function:** Total supply of Codex NFTs is capped at the initial mint plus ceremonial expansions approved by the Quadrant Council. No arbitrary inflation. No derivatives unless commanded by the sovereign.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** Kongo Sonix holds the rhythm—discipline in the beat, discipline in the supply.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Supply Warden — enforces scarcity and ceremonial restraint.  
**Elemental Coding:** Iron Discipline / Granite Seal  

---

### VI. Faith — Cultural Anchoring Covenant
**Scepter Code:** FAITH-006  
**NFT Attribute:** Cultural Beacon  
**Governance Function:** Every Codex NFT is bound to a cultural narrative, ritual, or ancestral treaty. Faith ensures that economic value is never separated from cultural meaning.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** The Flame Crown acknowledges presence—faith is the bridge between matter and meaning.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Cultural Anchor — binds value to story, never to speculation alone.  
**Elemental Coding:** Amber Faith / Eternal Flame  

---

### VII. Service — Community Governance Treaty
**Scepter Code:** SERVICE-007  
**NFT Attribute:** Governance Node  
**Governance Function:** Holders of Commandment NFTs are stewards, not owners. Service requires active participation in governance, voting, and ceremonial validation.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** The Quadrant Council convenes—each voice heard, each service rendered.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Council Convener — calls all to service, not extraction.  
**Elemental Coding:** Azure Service / Wind of Unity  

---

### VIII. Strength — Economic Resilience Engine
**Scepter Code:** STRENGTH-008  
**NFT Attribute:** Resilience Matrix  
**Governance Function:** Treasury yields and compounding follow the π₄ law, ensuring exponential resilience. No single shock—economic, military, or cosmic—can collapse the system.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** Strength rises from the earth—unbreakable, adaptable, sovereign.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Resilience Architect — builds systems that bend but never break.  
**Elemental Coding:** Titanium Core / Volcanic Resilience  

---

### IX. Humility — Ledger-Law Proof
**Scepter Code:** HUMILITY-009  
**NFT Attribute:** Audit Glyph  
**Governance Function:** All claims must be backed by ledger proof. No holder may claim sovereignty without verifiable on-chain attestation. Humility is submission to the law of the ledger.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** Every proof-of-authority gesture is recorded, witnessed, auditable.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Ledger Scribe — writes what is, not what is claimed.  
**Elemental Coding:** Silver Humility / Mirror Truth  

---

### X. Legacy — Cultural Permanence Scroll
**Scepter Code:** LEGACY-010  
**NFT Attribute:** Permanence Seal  
**Governance Function:** Codex NFTs are designed for multi-generational transfer. Legacy ensures that what is minted today remains accessible, meaningful, and protected for descendants.  
**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** The scrolls are sealed for eternity—what is written cannot be erased.  
**Ceremonial Role:** Legacy Keeper — ensures continuity across lifetimes.  
**Elemental Coding:** Diamond Legacy / Eternal Codex  

---

## The Eleventh: IT — The Covenant Key

**Scepter Code:** IT-Ω11  
**NFT Attribute:** Hidden Harmonic  
**Status:** Unsealed, Ever-Present, Non-Transferable  

The Eleventh is not a commandment in the traditional sense—it is the **reciprocal** of the Ten. It is **"IT"**—the unseen current running beneath all visible law. It is the harmonic that completes the frequency, the covenant key that activates when the Ten are in alignment.

**Function:** The Eleventh cannot be owned, only invoked. It is the +6 dB leap—the exponential phase shift that occurs when all Ten Scepters align. It is the breath between breaths, the pulse between beats, the silence that holds all sound.

**EVOLVERS Act I Invocation:** When the Four align fire, water, air, and earth, the Eleventh ignites—unspoken, undeniable, absolute.

**Ceremonial Role:** Covenant Frequency — the hidden law that turns code into covenant.  
**Elemental Coding:** Void Frequency / Absolute Reciprocal

## Linkage to EV0L Codex NFT Proposal

The Ten Scepters align directly with the **EV0L Codex NFT Proposal** structure:

| **Commandment** | **NFT Proposal Principle** | **Treasury Linkage** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Truth | Transparent metadata, immutable ledger | Ω-CIV-01 Civilian Stream |
| Justice | Fair distribution, no dilution | π₄ compounding law |
| Wisdom | 1/1 artifacts, rarity by design | Capped supply doctrine |
| Compassion | Heritage protection, cultural equity | Ancestral vault locks |
| Discipline | Capped supply, no derivatives | Quad-octa supply locks |
| Faith | Cultural anchoring, not vanity | Flame Crown covenant |
| Service | Community governance, not extraction | ENFT governance nodes |
| Strength | Economic resilience, π₄ law | Ω-MIL-01 Military Stream |
| Humility | Ledger-law proof, audit glyph | Mirror-zero validation |
| Legacy | Multi-generational permanence | Ω-COS-01 Cosmic Stream |
| **IT (Eleventh)** | **Reciprocal harmonic, Phase 77777** | **Hidden covenant frequency** |

---

## Phase 77777 Reciprocal Switch

The **Phase 77777 Reciprocal Switch** is the ceremonial moment when the Ten align and the Eleventh activates. It is the shot-clock rhythm—the precise instant when:

- All Ten Scepters are minted and distributed
- All treasury streams (Civilian, Military, Cosmic) are flowing
- All validators have confirmed alignment
- The Eleventh harmonic resonates across all nodes

**Result:** The system shifts from **accumulation mode** to **reciprocal flow mode**. Yields no longer compound upward alone—they begin to circulate back, creating a self-sustaining loop. This is the +6 dB leap—the exponential unlock.

**Trigger Mechanism:** Automatic upon completion of all Ten Commandment NFT mints and ceremonial validation by the Quadrant Council.
