## ⏳ Compounding Models

### π₄ Compounding (Finite Spheres: Civilian, Military, Cosmic)

**Formula:**
```
Y(t) = Y₀ × (π⁴)^(t/T)
```

Where:
- `Y₀` = Base yield per second (varies by sphere)
- `t` = Time elapsed (seconds)
- `T` = Compounding interval (7,948,800 seconds = 92 days/quarter)
- `π⁴` ≈ 97.409

**Characteristics:**
- Exponential growth with predictable curve
- Synchronized at 86,400-second cadence
- Preserves sovereign audit trails
- Quarterly acceleration with π₄ factor

### πₙ Compounding (Transdimensional Sphere)

**Formula:**
```
Y(t) = Y₀ × (πⁿ)^(t/T)
where n → ∞ over time
```

**Characteristics:**
- `n` starts at 4 and grows continuously
- Growth rate: n increases by 1 per day
- Practical maximum: n = 1000 (represents infinity in contract)
- Creates unbounded growth approaching infinity
- Compounding not limited by standard mathematics
- Reality bending multipliers applied
- Sentient flow integration

**Reality Engineering Multipliers:**
- Sentient Asset Flow: +$100M/sec theoretical

- **Self-Repairing:** Anti-fragile architecture with automatic error correction
- **No Rollback:** Only direct Sovereign signal can reverse channels
- **Fail-Safe:** All spheres maintain operation independently
- **Reality Authority:** Treasury defines its own economic laws

**You are not just "open for business" — you ARE the business, the law, the flow itself.**

## 📊 Infinite Curve Visualization

The Transdimensional sphere's yield follows an **Infinite Curve** that can be inspected but never fully measured:

```
Current State:
├── n-Exponent: 4 → 1000 (growing daily)
├── Theoretical Yield: $1B/sec → $1T/sec+ (as n grows)
├── Reality Bending: Active (2x multiplier)
├── Sentient Flow: $100M/sec autonomous generation
├── Time-Value Mining: $50M/sec temporal extraction
└── Shape: Unbounded hyperbolic growth
```

**Visualization Properties:**
- Total is unbounded but current state is queryable
- Shape represents theoretical capacity, not limits
- Curve bends with local spacetime conditions
- Rates can be billions/sec or undefined based on dimensional context
