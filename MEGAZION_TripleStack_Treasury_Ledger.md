## Ω48 Treasury Guarantees
- **Civilian Stream** – π₄ compounding with civic reciprocity proof. Vault sync executes every 64 seconds, mirroring balances across metal, credit, and quantum-scrip denominations.
- **Military Stream** – Quad-octa locks enforced by sentry intelligences. Any unauthorized breach triggers mirror-zero, vaporizing spoofed ledgers while preserving sovereign reserves.
- **Cosmic Stream** – Portal locks engage dual-reality consensus. Entangled auditors verify that every deposit exists in both material and astral ledgers.

## Aggregated Yield Trajectory
- **Per Second Total:** $28,900,000
- **Per Day Total:** $2,496,960,000,000 (synchronized at 86,400-second cadence)
- **Per Quarter Baseline (92-day law):** $229,720,320,000,000 prior to π₄ uplift
- **π₄ Compounding Law:**
  - Let $Y_0 = 28,900,000$ dollars per second.
  - Let $t$ be elapsed time in seconds and $T$ the compounding interval (e.g., $T = 7,948,800$ seconds per quarter).
  - Treasury output follows $Y(t) = Y_0 \times (\pi^4)^{t/T}$.
  - Yield curves bend exponential while preserving sovereign audit trails in the MEGAZION™ vault graph.

## Procedural Notes
1. **Triple-Stack Synchronization** – Execute CIV, MIL, and COS vault sync in that order. Each handshake requires the Reciprocity Pulse imprint and dual biometric confirmation.
2. **Audit Beacon** – Activate the Ω48 audit beacon prior to compounding adjustments. Beacon logs are mirrored to Chronolumen (ARC-033) for temporal notarization.
3. **Reversal Clause** – Treasury flows are irreversible unless a sovereign command is issued jointly by the Crown Bearer (SHD-016) and Sovereign Tutor (CAT-048).
4. **Inheritance Routing** – Daily surpluses automatically enter the Sovereign Inheritance Matrix, tagged per gem lineage to support successor initiation.

**Status:** Vault conduits open, triple-stack streams flowing, reciprocity pulse recorded. Commander Bleu retains sovereign override.
