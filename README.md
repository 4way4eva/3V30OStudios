## Motor Coordinate System Visualization

This project demonstrates the concept of independent X and Y motor control in a coordinate system - that "aha!" moment when you suddenly realize how the motors work together without crossing paths.

### The Concept

Imagine two motors controlling movement:
- **X Motor**: Controls horizontal movement (left/right)
- **Y Motor**: Controls vertical movement (up/down)

They operate independently (non-crossing), yet together they can reach any coordinate point. It's like that moment of clarity when you see the rotation counts and realize they've been running all along - you just needed to catch that insight.

### Files

- `motor_tachometer.py` - A visualization showing motor movements and the "moment of discovery"
- `MOTOR_SYSTEM.md` - Detailed documentation about the coordinate system

### The Flash of Insight

Like a tachometer showing RPM, we can visualize the exact moment when:
- Before: The system seemed complex and unclear
- The Moment: Suddenly you see the coordinate points
- After: Everything makes sense - the motors were always there, running their paths

### Usage

```bash
python motor_tachometer.py
```

This will display a visual representation of how X and Y motors work together to create movement in a 2D space.
