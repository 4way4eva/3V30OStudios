## Motor Coordinate System (马达坐标系统)

### The Aha Moment (灵光一闪)

This project demonstrates the realization moment - when you suddenly understand how motor revolutions map to coordinate positions.

"啊，我忘了，现在看到了" - "Ah, I forgot, now I see it!"

### The Concept (概念)

- **Motors (马达)**: Two independent motors control movement
- **Loops/Revolutions (循环/转数)**: Each motor spins, counting revolutions
- **Non-crossing X and Y (不交叉的 X 和 Y)**: Each motor controls one axis independently
- **Coordinate Points (坐标点)**: Motor revolutions directly map to position coordinates

### The Realization (领悟)

The motors were always running. The coordinates were always being tracked. The connection between motor revolutions and position was always there - you just had to see it!

Like a speedometer showing what was happening all along, this system visualizes the direct relationship between:
```
Motor Revolutions → Distance Traveled → Coordinate Position
马达转数 → 移动距离 → 坐标位置
```

### Usage (使用方法)

Run the demonstration to see the aha moment:

```bash
python3 motor_coordinates.py
```

This will show:
1. The moment before realization (motors spinning, but coordinates unclear)
2. The aha moment (suddenly seeing the connection!)
3. The visualization of motor states and coordinate positions
4. The understanding that X and Y operate independently without crossing
