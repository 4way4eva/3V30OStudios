## 2 · Triple Spiral Law
1. **Residual Capture** (10–20%) anchors infrastructure upkeep.  
2. **Reciprocal Routing** distributes reinvestment pools across ≥3 partner sectors.  
3. **Auto-Scholarship** (10–20%) perpetually funds stipends, residencies, guilds, and fellowships.

The computed surplus (30–50%) is guaranteed by clamping sector percentages against ledger constants.

```python
from hypergrid_engine import transactional_cycle

transactional_cycle(
    amount=1_000_000,
    sector_name="Agriculture & Ecology"
)
```

## 3 · Full Clearance Spectrum – Civic Health Protocol

1. **100% Neutralized Forever** – plague, lab-borne, and engineered pathogens neutralized.  
2. **Fully Dismantled** – toxins, carcinogenic microplastics, endocrine disruptors removed.  
3. **85% Lockdown** – seasonal pathogens suppressed; remaining 15% tracked via Blue Quantum Bomb Sweep.  
4. **Uncharted Zone Progress** – cryo-bacteria, abyssal organisms, latency strains mapped via OptiAquaMetaQology neural targeting.

### Antidote Families (Pre-First → Omega)
1. Alpha Pulse Clears – thought-frequency cures.  
2. Opticra Blue-Lens Healing – mitochondria quantum light infusion.  
3. MeatQuaOptic Nutritional Re-codes – food molecules repair DNA.  
4. Pupil-to-Pupil Neural Transmission – optic sync knowledge transfer.  
5. MetaQology Restoration Pods – 90-minute pathogen dissolution.  
6. Divine Breath Infrastructure – global medicinal air grid.

### Civilizational Medical Upgrade
- Self-healing cities with pathogen frequency walls.  
- EV0L Coin health-multiplied credit scores.  
- Public-domain cures eliminating monopolies.  
- Agro-forestry weaving curative crops into daily life.

### The 15% Final Sweep
1. Deploy Blue Quantum Bomb (frequency + bio-light).  
2. Opto-Neuro scans across ES0IL foundations.  
3. Lock the cycle—cured pathogens cannot return.

## 4 · Blue Zion City Threat-to-Peace Master Chart

### Curriculum Flow · Pre-K → Zion
- **Pre-K – Grade 3 · Healthy Earth, Healthy Me**  
  Animated EV0L guardians send germs “to the moon,” chloroplasts as solar shields, Bleu Coins for wellness.  
- **Grades 4–8 · Science of the Shield**  
  Cell membranes as castle walls, protons as energy soldiers, probability math vs immune strength.  
- **Grades 9–University · MetaQology Applied**  
  Opticra labs, economic dismantling of monopolies, judicial health rights.  
- **Zion Level · Guardians of the Blue Crown**  
  Integrates medical, judicial, economic, forestry systems for eternal immunity; leadership simulations and certification.

### Threat Vector Spiral (Deadliest → Dormant)
1. Super-killer pathogens (neutralized).  
2. Chemical warfare toxins (dismantled).  
3. Rapid-mutating bacteria (85% lockdown).  
4. Cryo-bacteria and abyssal organisms (tracked).  
5. Corporate trust erosion (countered by Bleu Zion governance).  
6. Cultural apathy (answered through curriculum lanes).

## 5 · Realm Axis Motors & Temporal Protocols
- **Axis Motors**: Dracula, Blade, Black Mamba Respiratory, Blue Dumbledore, Dr. Sosa Core.  
- **Honda Axis Pack**: Civic Drift, Accord Continuum, Type-R Time Pulse.  
- **REALMS**: Retrieval, Entry/Exit, Axis, Ledger, Military, Sabbaths.  
- **Time Travel Ops**: Watches as chrono-communicators, care packages via rift ports, safe return rules.

## 6 · Execution Checklist (Full Completion)
1. `hypergrid_engine.transactional_cycle` → deterministic economy cycles.  
2. `persistence_layer.save_and_hash` → immutable snapshotting.  
3. `metaverse_layer.sync_sector` → payload for AQUAEVOLVERSE nodes.  
4. `runtime/bleuchain_runtime.py` → looped execution heartbeat.  
5. Daily checksum + archival push → permanence.
