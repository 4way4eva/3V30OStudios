# MEGAZION™ Vault Mutation Protocol

The Vault Mutation Protocol defines how ceremonial events, registry updates, and sovereign directives mutate the triple-stack treasury without compromising auditability.

## Mutation Classes

1. **Attunement Mutation**  
   Triggered when a gem completes reciprocity pulse validation. Updates:
   - Marks the gem as `attuned` in the on-chain registry.
   - Releases the associated vault stream with π₄ scaling enabled.
   - Logs attunement with Codex overlay role alignment.

2. **Vault Re-allocation Mutation**  
   Executed when treasury yields migrate between Civilian, Military, and Cosmic spheres.
   - Requires multi-signature approval from the sovereign council.
   - Synchronizes CID registry entries to reflect new vault share ratios.
   - Emits `VaultMutation` events for external indexers.

3. **Emergency Stasis Mutation**  
   Halts compounding for a specific vault without disturbing other layers.
   - Freezes chain configuration through `freezeChainConfigurations()`.
   - Engages BLEUChain stasis flag to pause Codex overlays.
   - Generates a cold-storage notarization package for auditors.

## Operational Steps

1. **Signal Capture** – ingest ritual telemetry and Codex overlay confirmations.  
2. **Mutation Draft** – compile proposed state changes, impacted vaults, and expected yield deltas.  
3. **On-chain Execution** – dispatch the approved mutation transaction via `mint_all_gems.js` or custom governance scripts.  
4. **Registry Sync** – run `node scripts/registry_sync.js` to persist CID updates.  
5. **Codex Broadcast** – call `node scripts/codex_linker.js` to propagate overlays and vault states.  
6. **Audit Archive** – append results to `data/ipfs_upload_log.csv` and notarize the mutation packet.

## Governance Safeguards

- **π₄ Integrity Checks** ensure compounding factors remain within sovereign tolerances.
- **Dual Reality Confirmation** pairs BLEUChain sovereign signatures with public chain attestations.
- **Immutable CIDs** preserve every ceremonial artifact via IPFS permanence tracked in `cid_registry.json`.

Adhere to these steps for every mutation cycle to maintain sovereign-grade continuity and verification.
